Live App | GitHub | Case study

Collaborative web platform connecting “neighbours” — whether local or virtual — to offer and
request help.
I initiated the concept and worked with fellow Launch School graduates to bring it to life,
designing the database schema and backend logic using TypeScript, Express, and Prisma
ORM.
React was used on the frontend to deliver a clean, intuitive interface.
This project emphasized teamwork across time zones, structured workflow via GitHub issues,
and clean architecture between client and server.
